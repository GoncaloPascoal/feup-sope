2. b) An error occurs: 'undefined reference to main'. The compiler couldn't
find the main function in the source files.

3. c) The return value of ls was 0.
 
4. a) We can pass multiple word names using quotes, for example:
./hello "John Smith"

6. b) The program doesn't execute correctly because there is no file named
infile.txt.
c) The return value of main is 1.
f) The contents of infile.txt are copied to outfile.txt

7. b) The exit handlers are usually called in reverse order of their 
registration (for example, if we register atexit1 and then atexit2, the 
program will call atexit2 and then atexit1). If abort() is called in the 
main function, the exit handlers will not run. If one of the exit handlers
ends with an exit() call, the others will still run.
